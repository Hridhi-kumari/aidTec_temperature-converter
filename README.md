# Project Title
I develop this project during my internship at Info aidTech.

It is a simple temperature converter website allows users to convert temperatures from one unit to another.
It typically has an input field for user to enter the temperature in a perticular unit (such as Celsius or Fehremheit), and buttons to select the desired output unit (such as Celsius, Fehrenheit, or Kelvin).
